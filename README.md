# CardboxIOS
CardBox is an iOS application that enables the user to learn new knowledge using spaced repetition and flashcards. The application provides different decks of cards related to a specific area that help to master concepts specific to the deck. The tool is ideal for learning foreign languages and mastering new concepts. The decks may be learned one-by-one, or a switch is also possible between them. The user interface enables simple communication between the user and the application through a feedback process where users can determine which cards to repeat more often, and which to skip.
